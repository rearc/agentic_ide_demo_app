# Architecture Decision Records - agentic_ide_demo_app

Architectural decisions for the multi-card personal dashboard. Each ADR captures the
"why" behind a choice that cannot be inferred from the code alone.

Decisions are stored **one file per decision** (`ADR-NNN-<slug>.md`) so an agent can
open just the relevant record for the work at hand without reading every decision. The
grill and plan phases of the SDLC flow read these; keep them focused.

## Adding a new ADR

1. Copy the format of any existing ADR: H1 `# ADR-NNN: Title`, then `**Date:**` /
   `**Status:**`, then `## Context`, `## Decision`, `## Consequences`.
2. Number sequentially (`ADR-016-...`) with a short kebab-case slug in the filename.
3. Add a row to the index table above.
4. Never edit the substance of an accepted ADR after the fact. If a decision is
   reversed or replaced, add a new ADR and mark the old one `Superseded by ADR-NNN`.

See [`ADR_CREATION_PROMPT.md`](../../ADR_CREATION_PROMPT.md) at the repo root for the
interactive drafting prompt.
