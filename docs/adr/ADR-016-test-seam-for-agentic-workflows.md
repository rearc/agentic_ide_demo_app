# ADR-016: A Test Seam for Agentic Workflows

**Date:** July 2026
**Status:** Accepted (supersedes ADR-010)

### Context

ADR-010 recorded that this codebase had no automated tests. It described the
absence as acknowledged debt rather than a principle: tests had originally been
left out for simplicity, a different codebase was chosen for the workshop's TDD
demo, and the gap was simply never closed. It explicitly noted that adding a test
suite "would be a valuable future contribution."

Two things then made that gap load-bearing rather than merely untidy.

**The demo flow needs somewhere to land.** The Section 4 workflow drives this app
through a chain of skills. `/implement` runs `/tdd` at seams and runs the suite as
it works; with no harness, test-driven development has nowhere to go and the step
degrades into a narrated intention. `/code-review` runs two axes, one of which
checks a change against the repo's documented coding standards; with no standards
document, only the spec axis functioned. An agent working unattended has nothing
to verify its own work against, which undercuts the argument that autonomy is
safe once the controls exist.

**The suite is itself a teaching artifact.** Agents extending this app read the
existing tests and write new ones in their image. That makes the suite's idiom -
naming, structure, what a fallback path looks like when tested - as consequential
as its coverage. A thin token suite would teach a thin token habit.

There was also a live risk to manage. Three services call external APIs
(Open-Meteo, ZenQuotes, NASA APOD). A suite that reached the network would fail
in a room full of attendees sharing a connection and a rate limit - during the
exact demo it exists to support.

### Decision

Add a real test suite and a coding standards document.

- **Backend:** pytest over the app factory, with an in-memory SQLite `TestConfig`
  and per-test schema creation. Covers the three services on both their happy and
  graceful-fallback paths, the `/api/cards`, `/api/data/<source>` and `/api/todos`
  routes, and the `Card` and `Todo` models. Test-only dependencies live in
  `backend/requirements-dev.txt` so the runtime dependency list stays honest.
- **Frontend:** vitest with @testing-library/react and jsdom. Covers `api.js`,
  the `Card.jsx` registry dispatch, `Dashboard.jsx`'s lock state and debounced
  layout save, and all five card components.
- **Determinism is a hard requirement.** Autouse fixtures in both suites fail any
  HTTP request a test did not explicitly register, so neither suite can reach the
  network, and both are safe to run offline and in parallel with a live demo.
- **`create_app()` takes an optional config object.** This is the structural
  change the suite required: the factory previously hardcoded `config.Config`, so
  there was no way to point it at a test database. The default is unchanged, so
  `run.py`, `seed.py`, and the Alembic environment are unaffected. The other
  production edits made alongside it are defect fixes the new tests justified: a
  stray `console.log`, an unused parameter, and two missing null guards.
- **`docs/coding_standards.md` is the authoritative standards document.** It
  consolidates the four `.claude/rules/` files into one self-contained, reviewable
  document with stable rule IDs, and adds testing standards. The rules files keep
  their bodies - they are working exhibits of the always-on rules primitive - but
  each now names the standards doc as the source of truth. Standards live outside
  the always-on agent context deliberately: they matter at review time, and
  injecting them into every prompt spends context on rules irrelevant to most
  edits.

**This does not make the application production-ready, and is not an attempt to.**
ADR-001 stands unchanged: no Docker, no production WSGI server, no CI/CD, no
HTTPS, no auth. Those omissions are deliberate and remain so. ADR-001 already drew
the line this ADR sits on - "production-quality code" means structure, clarity,
and correctness, not deployment readiness - and a test suite is squarely on the
code-quality side of it. The suite exists to give the agentic workflow a seam to
work at, not to prepare the app for deployment.

### Consequences

- `/implement` and `/tdd` have a real harness; `/code-review`'s standards axis has
  a document with citable rule IDs.
- An agent working unattended can prove its own work with a single command per
  side, and the branch it produces can be judged on whether the suite still passes.
- Refactoring is safer, and the registry patterns in ADR-008 now have executable
  documentation: adding a card type means copying an existing service test and
  adding a dispatch case.
- Contributors must keep two suites green, and new behavior is expected to arrive
  with tests (`TEST-1`). This is a real ongoing cost, accepted deliberately.
- The suites are a maintenance surface of their own. Because they mock at the
  network boundary, a change to a service's external contract will not be caught
  by them - that risk is accepted in exchange for determinism.
- Some tests deliberately pin behavior that is wrong rather than right. Deleting a
  card does not delete its todos, because SQLite ships with foreign keys disabled
  and the app never enables them; `create_card` silently ignores a supplied
  `layout`. These are asserted as-is, with an `xfail(strict=True)` stating the
  desired behavior, so they surface as known defects instead of being invisible.
- ADR-010 is superseded. Its account of *why* tests were originally absent remains
  accurate history.
