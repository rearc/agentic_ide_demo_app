"""Tests that the Alembic chain runs forwards and backwards.

`DB-5` in docs/coding_standards.md requires every migration to have a working
`downgrade()`. That is only credible if something exercises it, so these tests
run the whole chain up and back down against a throwaway file database.

A file database rather than `:memory:` because Alembic opens its own connection,
and each connection to an in-memory SQLite URI gets a database of its own.
